Shalf, John & Leland, Robert. (2015). Computing beyond Moore's Law. Computer. 48. 14-23. 10.1109/MC.2015.374. Photolithography systems are on pace to reach atomic scale by the mid-2020s, necessitating alternatives to continue realizing faster, more predictable, and cheaper computing performance. If the end of Moore's law is real, a research agenda is needed to assess the viability of novel semiconductor technologies and navigate the ensuing challenges.
